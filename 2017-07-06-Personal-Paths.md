# Personal Paths

The personal path system is a method for delivering a series of online lessons which are known as activities. Each activity focuses on a specific topic, and they build on each other.  Each activity relays information about a given subject through the use of different types of steps, or the pages which path participants view inside an activity. Activities can contain text, videos, images, and discussion questions.

## Path Subscriptions

Path subscriptions are given to new members automatically if they join a team which has been granted access to a path. The join code plays a part in granting members access to the path system in that it allows them to join a team and/or a specific group within that team, but the path subscription and other settings are managed independently of membership inside a group or a team. In fact, the current path system is designed such a way which allows users to continue working on their path even after they have left a team.

## Launching Your Path

There are two places where you can launch your personal path: from the Main navigation, located either next to the logo or in the left hand menu when you're viewing the metrics or other similar pages, and from the right hand side of the metrics page.

Students will also be able to use the link in the site's main navigation to launch their path again if they happen to exit out. Students are automatically taken into their path each time that they log into their account on the site.

## Interacting with Path Activities

There are a number of elements and controls which you can use as you are navigating through an activity in the path.

[ Activity Screen ]

1. **Progress Bar** - The progress bar shows you how far you are in the current activity. It will reset each time that you start a new activity.

2. **Left/right navigation** - You can move backwards or forward by clicking on either the right or the left arrow. On discussion steps, the forward arrow will become active after you've entered a response which meets the step’s minimum word count.

3. **Media Content Area** - The side of the step will display any media content, such as videos, images, graphs, or additional text. When it's not being used, a watermark will appear.

4. **Comment form** - This is where users can enter their response to the step's message or questions.

5. **Word minimum counter** - By default, the step will display the word count minimum for any response that's asked for by the step. As the user types, this number will go down. When the counter reaches "0," they have reached the minimum and will be able to submit their answer.

6. **Plus submit button** - When you're ready to submit  your response, you can either hit the enter button or click on the plus submit button. Your comment will be saved and appear below the step’s message.

7. **Message area** - The text with the blue button is the step's main message.

8. **Hamburger Menu** - Click on the hamburger menu icon over on the left hand side to expand the path menu.
