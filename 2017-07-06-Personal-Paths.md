Personal Paths

The personal path system is a method for delivering a series of online lessons which are known as activities. Each activity focuses on a specific topic, and they build on each other.  Each activity relays information about a given subject through the use of different types of steps, or the pages which path participants view inside an activity. Activities can contain text, videos, images, and discussion questions.

## Path Subscriptions

Path subscriptions are given to new members automatically if they join a team which has been granted access to a path. The join code plays a part in granting members access to the path system in that it allows them to join a team and/or a specific group within that team, but the path subscription and other settings are managed independently of membership inside a group or a team. In fact, the current path system is designed such a way which allows users to continue working on their path even after they have left a team.
